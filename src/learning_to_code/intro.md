# Learning to code
In this chapter, I will guide you through learning to code. Please note that this is not a step-by-step guide, as you will need to mess around a bit yourself to really understand it all.

## Prerequisites
For this chapter you need:

- An internet connection
- A web browser (You are probably reading this with one!)
- Motivation

Everything you need to install will be installed when needed.

And with that note, have fun!
