# First Steps
Now this may sound silly, but using a kids program to start learning programming is actually pretty smart.

Yup, you might have already guessed it but we are going to start by using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).

## Fundamentals
Now listen closely, because you will need this information for later in this chapter almost everywhere.

```rust
# fn main() {
todo!()
# }
```
